        <header>A CSS & JavaScript Library designed to display clean and neat code</header>
        <p>Prism.js is a lightweight and robust syntax highlighting library that can be used to display code on web pages.</p>
        <p>It provides a set of pre-built CSS classes and JavaScript components that can be used to create syntax highlighting for various programming languages.</p>

        <header>Why use a syntax highlighter library?</header>
        <p>Easy to read formatting helps users focus on the important thing, the code, rather than employ brain power attempting to guess the correct way of interpreting raw, unformatted text. Not to mention having trouble indentifying colors.</p>
        <p>Its polished and elegant look enhances the experience of interacting with your website.</p>
